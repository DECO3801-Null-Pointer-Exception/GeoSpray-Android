# GeoSpray-Android

Application that allows users to place virtual artwork on surfaces and share it with other users.

Currently based on Android.

Built with Android Studio, using the ARCore Geospatial API and Firebase.

## Project Outline
The project involves developing an interactive Augmented Reality (AR) experience. This experience will utilise virtual “graffiti” that users can create using an in-built interface. This digital art can be placed on flat surfaces (for example, a wall) and viewed by passersby through the application, seamlessly blending the virtual and real worlds. Users can geo-tag their creations to specific locations, enabling a contextual connection between art and place. The application fosters community engagement, allowing users to discover, rate and appreciate each other’s virtual graffiti. This will create a dynamic platform that merges artistic expression with AR technology.
